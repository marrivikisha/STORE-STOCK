## Plan: Review and Enhance Rustaq Store Management HTML/JS

This plan covers reviewing the provided HTML/JS for the Rustaq Store Management app, identifying any issues, and suggesting improvements or customizations as needed. The code is a full-featured inventory management dashboard with modules for transactions, stock, arrivals, and calibration, including export and print features.

### Steps
1. **Review HTML Structure and UI**  
   - Check layout, module navigation, and form fields for completeness and usability.
2. **Analyze JavaScript Logic**  
   - Examine data handling, filtering, form submission, and export/print logic.
3. **Identify Issues or Gaps**  
   - Look for UI/UX bugs, missing features, or code inefficiencies.
4. **List Recommendations or Requested Changes**  
   - Suggest UI/UX improvements, code refactoring, or new features based on findings or user feedback.
5. **Prepare Actionable Implementation Steps**  
   - Outline concrete changes for each improvement or fix, referencing relevant code sections.

### Further Considerations
1. **Clarify User Goals:**  
   - Are you seeking bug fixes, new features, UI changes, or code optimization?
2. **Export/Print Customization:**  
   - Should export formats or print layouts be changed or extended?
3. **Data Persistence:**  
   - Is the current SDK-based storage sufficient, or is backend/database integration needed?
